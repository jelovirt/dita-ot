<title>Installing DITA-OT plug-ins</title>
<shortdesc>Plug-ins are generally distributed as zip files. There
are two steps to installing a plug-in: unzipping, and integrating.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>It is possible to define a plug-in so that it may be installed
anywhere, although most expect to be placed in either the <filepath>demo/</filepath> or <filepath>plugins/</filepath> directory
inside of the DITA-OT. Most plug-ins do not require a specific install
directory and can go in either of the default locations, but some
may come with instructions for a particular install directory. The
first step to installing a plug-in is to unzip to the desired location.</p><p>The
remaining step is to integrate the new plug-in. This can be accomplished
in a few ways.<ol>
<li>From the toolkit directory, you can run the following command
to integrate all installed plug-ins:<codeblock>ant -f integrator.xml</codeblock><?Pub
Caret -1?></li>
<li>Any build that uses the Java command line interface automatically
runs the integrator before processing begins.</li>
<li>Ant based builds may import the <codeph>integrator.xml</codeph> file,
and add <codeph>integrate</codeph> to the start of the dependency
chain for the build.</li>
</ol></p></section>
