The DTD files include several of the OASIS DITA 1.0 domains along
with the music specialization itself. OASIS modules are pulled in
from the toolkit's DTD directory; new files for this specialization
are all located in this directory.</p>
<div class="section">The directory actually contains two distinct specializations:<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The song collection specialization is much newer. It declares
a new songCollection topic type, which primarily consists of a specialized
table intended to define one song per row. Most of the samples in
this plug-in use the song collection specialization.</li>
<li class="li">The older music collection specialization uses a specialized table
to define information about individual CDs. This specialization is
older and has not been updated recently.</li>
