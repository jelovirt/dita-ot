<body><h2>Music library, converted from iTunes XML to DITA</h2>
<p>The frame on the left is generated in the browser based on a DITA map, pointing to information encoded in the DITA music specialization (see the DITA Open Toolkit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132728" target="_external">download page</a>).
The links are all to DITA XML files which will resolve in the browser.</p>
<p>Note that the display is not very well NLS enabled, but that may be updated for at least a
couple of languages in the future.</p>
<p>Much of this music can be purchased at your local independent music shop.</p>
