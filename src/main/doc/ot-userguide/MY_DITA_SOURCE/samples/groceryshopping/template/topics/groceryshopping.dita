<!-- The DOCTYPE statement declares the information type (in this case, DITA topic) and indicates the location of the document type
definition (DTD) for a DITA topic. The DITA Open Toolkit uses its catalog rather than the location information below to find the DTDs.
If your editor is also set up to use a catalog, you should get no validation errors as you work on these files.
If your editor is NOT set up to use a catalog, you must do one of the following to avoid editor validation errors: 
(1) configure your editor to use a catalog, 
(2) change the relative path below to indicate the current location of the DTDs, or 
(3) put the DTDs in the location indicated below.
