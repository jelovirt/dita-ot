<!-- The DOCTYPE statement declares the information type (in this case, DITA topic) and indicates the location of the document type
definition (DTD) for a DITA topic. The DITA Open Toolkit uses its catalog rather than the location information below to find the DTDs.
If your editor is also set up to use a catalog, you should get no validation errors as you work on these files.
If your editor is NOT set up to use a catalog, you must do one of the following to avoid editor validation errors: 
(1) configure your editor to use a catalog, 
(2) change the relative path below to indicate the current location of the DTDs, or 
(3) put the DTDs in the location indicated below.

		<context>Canned goods are usually stored on grocery store shelves by type of foodâ€”for example, all canned vegetables in one aisle and all canned fruits in another. Say you are looking for canned olives:</context>
		<steps>
			<step>
				<cmd>Find the olive display by reading the directional signs or asking a store clerk for help.</cmd>
				</step>
				<step>
				<cmd>Locate the type of olives you want to buy: green or black.</cmd>
				<info>If you're looking for ingredients for a green salad, green olives might be a better choice. If you're making enchiladas, look for cans of black olives.</info>
			</step>
			<step>
				<cmd>Check the sizes and prices to determine the best buy.</cmd>
				<info>For example, if you're planning to make enchiladas tonight and tacos on Friday, a larger can would probably be a better buy.</info>
			</step>
			<step>
				<cmd>Select a can and look it over carefully to be sure it has no dents that would cause the seal to be broken.</cmd>
			</step>
			<step>
				<cmd>Put the can in your cart, finish your shopping, and check out.</cmd>
			</step>
