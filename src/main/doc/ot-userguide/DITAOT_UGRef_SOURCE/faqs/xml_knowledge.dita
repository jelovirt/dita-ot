		<p>XML's a funny beastâ€”people imagine that it has all kinds of mystical powers, but it's little more than a set of rules for how to structure data.  
		I'll try to work in a reference to the emperor's new clothes here.</p>
		<p>If all you plan to do is write topics in DITA, then you need to know very little about XML.  If you're going to use a newfangled WYSIWYG editor to hide
	the structure from you, then you might be able to get by knowing nothing at all about XML.  If you stay in plaintext-land, then I'd list the following XML ideas as essential:
	<ul>
				<li>Elements and attributes</li>
				<li>Angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;), ampersand (&amp;), slashes, and quotation marks (" and ")</li>
				<li>Content models (the idea that elements contain other elements)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>These would be nice, too:
		<ul>
				<li>Doctypes</li>
				<li>Well-formedness vs. validity</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Don't let anyone try to talk you into studying these in the short term:
		<ul>
				<li>DTDs and schemas</li>
				<li>XSLT</li>
				<li>Namespaces</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>After that, it's probably just a matter of brushing up on DITA's ideas of content models.</p>
		<p>The above doesn't hold if you are planning to write your own specializations or transformations.</p>
		<p>If you want to understand the internals of the DITA Open Toolkit, then you are in for a bumpier ride, because you'll need to become acquainted
with Ant, Java, XSLT, and how they all talk to each other.</p>
