System modifications made to this project for DITA Open Toolkit 1.3.1

(List of customizations made at the 1.3.1 level.)

Created CustomCatalog.xml for XMLSPY editor.

Corrected bookmap DTD syntax error (demo/book/bookmap.mod).

Installed Idiom PDF2 1.2 plug-in.

Installed RenderX XEP 4.9 Engine FO Formatter.

Fixed problem with rendering uicontrol in Idiom 1.2 plugin (arrow character changed to greater than).

The index.html file in the build_files directory enables the frameset
in the XHTML output. It is copied into the output directory in
a post-processing step.

(This list will be useful in identifying files that
need to be backed up in preparation for installing the next release,
and in understanding what mods might need to be repeated
in the next release.)
