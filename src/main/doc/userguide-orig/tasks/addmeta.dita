<title>Adding metadata to elements</title>
<shortdesc>You can use attributes to provide information about what product,
audience, or platform an element applies to, or what revision it is part of.</shortdesc>

<taskbody>
<prereq>Before you use these attributes, you should work with your team to
agree on a consistent set of values for use across your information set.
Do not define your own values without consulting team mates, or your content
may not build properly when it is reused.</prereq>
<context>Use these attributes when you have content within a topic or a map
that applies to only one or some of the products, platforms, or audiences
for the topic or map as a whole.</context>
<steps>
<step><cmd>Select the element you want to provide information for.</cmd><info>If
the element doesn't have the attributes you need, try creating an element
inside it, like a ph, that can hold the attributes instead.</info></step>
<step><cmd>Select the attribute for the information you want to provide:</cmd>
<choicetable>
<chrow><choption>product</choption><chdesc>The product that the element applies
to.</chdesc></chrow>
<chrow><choption>platform</choption><chdesc>The platform (typically hardware,
operating system, or both) that the element applies to.</chdesc></chrow>
<chrow><choption>audience</choption><chdesc>The audience that the element
applies to, Could be a user role (like administrator), experience level (novice),
or combination (novice-admin).</chdesc></chrow>
<chrow><choption>otherprops</choption><chdesc>Any other category of metadata.</chdesc>
</chrow>
<chrow><choption>rev</choption><chdesc>The revision that the element is part
of, if the topic has been revised and you want to track what stage particular
content was added at.</chdesc></chrow>
</choicetable>
</step>
<step><cmd>Add a value or values to the attribute.</cmd><stepxmp>For example,
audience="novice-admin expert-user" or platform="wintel".</stepxmp></step>
<step importance="optional"><cmd>For <i>audience</i> or <i>product</i>, add
an equivalent element to the prolog metadata.</cmd><info>You can provide more
information about your audience or product values in the topic's prolog, inside
the metadata element. To ensure consistency, you can define the elements in
one place for the entire information set, and then reuse them in topics that
require them by using the <i>conref</i> attribute.</info></step>
</steps>
<result>Metadata attributes are inherited: they apply to any elements they
contain as well. In a table, metadata for a column applies to all the cells
in the column.</result>
