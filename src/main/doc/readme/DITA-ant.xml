<conbody>
<section><title>Introduction to Ant</title><p>Ant is a Java-based,
open source tool provided by the Apache Foundation to declare a sequence
of build actions. It is well suited for development builds as well
as document builds. The "Full Easy Install" version of the toolkit
ships with a copy of Ant.</p><p>The DITA-OT provides a set of XSLT
scripts for producing different types of documentation, such
as help output in Eclipse, Java Help and HTML Help, XHTML pages, and
PDF. The toolkit uses Ant to manage these scripts, as well as to manage
additional intermediate steps written in Java. </p></section>
