<section id="overview" conref="DITA-messages.xml#msgs/overview" conaction="pushreplace"><p>By convention, messages in the toolkit follow
a simple pattern:<ul>
<li>Message prefix (generally 4 letters) that indicates where the
message comes from; for example, DOTX is used for messages from the
core toolkit XSLT steps.</li>
<li>Message number</li>
<li>Message severity</li>
</ul></p><p>Message severities include:<ul>
<li>I (Informational): the toolkit has encountered a situation that
may not be what you intended, but will not cause problems in processing.</li>
<li>W (Warning): a problem has been encountered which should be corrected.
Processing will generally attempt to recover and continue, but the
results may not be as expected.</li>
<li>E (Error): a more severe problem has been encountered, such as
invalid or missing content. Results will not be as expected.</li>
<li>F (Fatal): processing cannot continue; the problem must be resolved
in order to produce output.</li>
</ul></p><p>Plug-ins may be used to add additional messages into the
toolkit; for more information, see the Developer reference section
of the User Guide. If you would like to rebuild the documentation
to include any newly integrated messages, first run the following
command from the <filepath>DITA-OT/doc/</filepath> directory.</p><codeblock>DITA-OT/doc/ant -f build.xml generate-msg-topic</codeblock><p>After
running the command, rebuild the documentation to your desired output
format. You an also use that same build file to build the full guide
to PDF, XHTML, or HTML Help, all of which will automatically 
recreate this message topic.</p></section>

of the way XML and DITA are defined, it is generally not possible to prohibit adding a second title
to a section during editing (or to force that title to come first). However, the DITA specification states that only one title should
be used. When multiple titles are found, only the first one will appear in the output.</stentry></strow>
